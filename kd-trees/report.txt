1. Hours to complete the project: 18 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Brute-force Implementation): It was fairly simple after 
              understanding the concept of Red Black BST. I was unable to
              understand how to implement it but after Kyler told me I was
              able to solve it.

   Problem 2 (2d-tree Implementation): This problem required considerable
              though as it was lengthy code as well as a lot of conceptual
              topics. The problems I faced were in the put and point iterator.
              Firstly, I was unable to determine the new rectangle's coordinate
              on which Kyler was a huge help. And I was able to solve point
              iterator once I clearly understood the pruning rules.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Kyler Mikulski      SI          Helped me understand the concept for second
                                   problem. And then helped me figure out the
                                   new rectangles at every put method. Also
                                   taught me how to use each pruning rule,
                                   especially for nearest point and it's 
                                   iteration.



4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   1. Great project but too hard for Freshman Level.
   2. Lengthy code and too much recursion which required too much of
      thinking.
