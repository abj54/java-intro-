1. Hours to complete the project: 17 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Board Data Type): After understanding what we have to do and
                                able to figure out the helper function,
                                this was a pretty straight forward problem.
                                The thought required was really high as we
                                had to find different values under different 
                                conditions. The issue that I faced was in
                                neighbors but Professor helped me and
                                I was able to solve it.
                                

   Problem 2 (Solver Data Type): Solving Solver was the only hard part in this
                                 problem as everything else was straight. Even
                                 in solver, understanding and following 
                                 checklist was strictly needed as that made 
                                 this problem considerably easier. I had one
                                 issue but was able to solve it with my mate.

  

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   1. The project checklist was out really late as we were in the Springs
      Break and we also had the exams the very next week.
   2. It was a fun problem but maybe checklist could have been a lot better
      like the first few checklists.
   3. Considering it was a tough project, may be time extension would have 
      helped as we also had the exam.
