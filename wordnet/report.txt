1. Hours to complete the project: 12 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (WordNet Data Type): SI helped us understood the file format
      for sysnets and hypernyms and also the use of two symbol tables to 
      store the data. After that it was fairly simple to solve the remaining
      problems. 

   Problem 2 (ShortestCommonAncestor Data Type): After learning BFS concept
      to implement distTo method, this part was fairly simple. triad method
      was a bit different compared to what we have done till now but the 
      help is piazza was quite sufficient to understand it. All the other
      methods were dependent on these two methods.

   Problem 3 (Outcast Data Type): It was the easiest of all as all we had to
     do was keep adding the distance between the two nouns and compare it
     with the largest distance to return the string. 




4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   1. After doing K-D Tree, it was a relief for us.
   2. Requires though but solvable project.
